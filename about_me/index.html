    <h2>Elyssa Snyder</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Elyssa and I live in Pleasant Grove Utah but I was born and raised in Buford Georgia! I was born and raised in the church and am 22 years old, turning 23 later this year. Some of my hobbies include gaming and baking! I can bake almost anything but I love to bake different breads my favorite to make is pumpkin bread! I also collect weapons and tiaras. I have an assortment of medieval weapons that I love and cherish and 3 of my tiaras are shown in my picture haha. I'm not good at talking about myself but feel free to ask questions! I can't wat to get to know yall better!</p>
