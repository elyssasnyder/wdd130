                <h4>Food! Glorious food! No festival is complete without some good grub and renaissance faire is no different! They have everything from homemade root beer and cream soda to massive turkey legs, and from pizza to sweet treats! Even the pickiest eater will find something there they would like and if they don’t, well they didn’t look hard enough! From various food trucks selling an assortment of cuisines and dishes to drink trucks that have you roll massive dice to see if you get a free drink they really have everything. ‘Oh but Your Majesty, I want to be able to bring food home with me and those all sound like things you can’t do that with.’ Fear not peasant! They also have prepackaged candy and bags of gourmet popcorn or if you’re feeling extra fancy, they also have stalls that sell those fancy flavored olive oils and balsamic vinegars! Remember when I said they had something for everyone? Yeah, I wasn’t kidding. Come, sample a bit of everything and transform your pallet from one of a peasant to one of a KING!</h4>
