        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Welcome</h3>
      <p>
        The Home Page will be more of a welcome page that details briefly what renfaire is and what it entails by saying something snarky like “What is Renaissance Faire? Well, for starters it’s a fair or festival. There’s many different booths set up that you can buy hand crafted items from. There’s more don’t worry. If shopping doesn’t pique your interest that’s fine too, there’s also informational booths, these booths tell you how things were done back in the renaissance time. These booths are usually black smiths and tailors that double as shops. But wait! Isn’t the renaissance faire where all the nerds go and dress up and pretend to be people they aren’t? While technically you are correct, there are plenty of people dressed up in costumes and larping, you don’t have to be dressed up to attend, and to sweeten the deal they encourage you to bring the princes and princesses of your noble house along for some fun! There are activities available solely for them so while they get their face painted with their King or Queen standing by, you can go shop to your hearts content or watch a real blacksmith forge a sword! Have I got you hooked yet? No? Shame on me, but you should look at everything they have to offer anyways!”

      <h3>Activities</h3>
      <p>
        This page will detail the activities available. The text on this page will be along the lines of “You’re still here? I must’ve done something right then! While looking at the booths and things for sale is nice, you can do that at any old festival! What sets renaissance faire apart from the rest is there are many activities and things to do and see! Take your kids to go see the mermaids or get their faces painted. Maybe go and watch the performers sing and dance or sit back and watch 2 guys on horses hit each other with long sticks! Or if you don’t want to just sit back and watch things head over to one of the blacksmiths and shoot some arrows or head over to the open field area that has nothing but targets and throw the hatchets, that’s a personal favorite. If you’re not an actiony type person that’s fine too. If you just want to sit somewhere and people watch and see all the amazing costumes, I promise you’re not going to be the only one doing so! Regardless of what you choose to do there’s something for everyone and the whole family to enjoy!”

      <h3>Food</h3>
      <p>
        This page will outline various foods that they will have available at the renaissance faire. The text on this page will probably be along the lines of “Food! Glorious food! No festival is complete without some good grub and renaissance faire is no different! They have everything from homemade root beer and cream soda to massive turkey legs, and from pizza to sweet treats! Even the pickiest eater will find something there they would like and if they don’t, well they didn’t look hard enough! From various food trucks selling an assortment of cuisines and dishes to drink trucks that have you roll massive dice to see if you get a free drink they really have everything. ‘Oh but your majesty, I want to be able to bring food home with me and those all sound like things you can’t do that with.’ Fear not plebeian! They also have prepackaged candy and bags of gourmet popcorn or if you’re feeling extra fancy, they also have stalls that sell those fancy flavored olive oils and balsamic vinegars! Remember when I said they had something for everyone? Yeah, I wasn’t kidding. Come, sample a bit of everything and transform your pallet from one of a plebeian to one of a KING!”
