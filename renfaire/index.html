                <h4> What is Renaissance Faire? Well, for starters it’s a fair or festival. There’s many different booths set up that you can buy hand crafted items from. There’s more don’t worry. If shopping doesn’t pique your interest that’s fine too, there’s also informational booths, these booths tell you how things were done back in the renaissance time. These booths are usually black smiths and tailors that double as shops. But wait! Isn’t the renaissance faire where all the nerds go and dress up and pretend to be people they aren’t?</h4>

                <h4>While technically you are correct, there are plenty of people dressed up in costumes and larping, you don’t have to be dressed up to attend, and to sweeten the deal they encourage you to bring the princes and princesses of your noble house along for some fun! There are activities available solely for them so while they get their face painted with their King or Queen standing by, you can go shop to your hearts content or watch a real blacksmith forge a sword! Have I got you hooked yet? No? Shame on me, but you should look at everything they have to offer anyways!</h4>
